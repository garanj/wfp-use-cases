# Watch Face Push additional use cases

The [Watch Face Push][1] API allows Wear OS developers to build marketplaces for watch faces.

However, it also opens to the door to a whole host of additional use cases.

The samples in this repository explore some of these opportunities

- [DeviceDataWatchFace](DeviceDataWatchFace) - explores how to couple a watch face with a `ForegroundService` to display data from a connected device.
- [FootballWatchFace](FootballWatchFace) - demonstrates how to change colors, images and data to match the user's favorite team from their mobile app.
- [PaletteWatchFace](PaletteWatchFace) - explores how to set the color theme of a watch face dynamically using a bundled complication.
- [PhotoWatchFace](PhotoWatchFace) - uses `WorkManager` to show how a watch face can connect to an online photo service.
- [SurfWatchFace](SurfWatchFace) - Rich-data watch face demonstrating how custom data sources can be represented
